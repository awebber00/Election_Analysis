## Overview of Election Audit
I am helping Seth and Tom submit election results to the election commission. Additionally they would also like to know:

2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout
```

# Election-Audit Summary
This script can be modified to be used for other elections by obtaining a .csv file of the future election data that you want to get results for and using that data in conjunction with the script to give you your results. This script can also be used for non election/political purposes such as determining smaller events across different counties and regions.
